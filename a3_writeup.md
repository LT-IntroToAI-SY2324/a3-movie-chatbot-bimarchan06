## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.

Search_pa_list is a function used to try to match a pattern with the string it's being compared to. It searches through the string to see if there are any matches if there isn't then an action is done which is when the progrm either returns "I don't understand" or "No answer".

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?

I added Final destination. It was made in 2000. I added it because I really like the series.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?

The action added to paList was the return statement of "No answer", "I don't understand" or if there's an answer the answer is returned. The pattern varible is compared to the string variable.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.

I would like to create a resturant chatbot. A person can make ask questions about the menu like what combinations of entrees they want, the different drink options, sides and deserts. They will also be able to ask questions of what are in foods and entrees.

The most difficult portion of the assignment was trying to understand how search_pa_list works. Once I ran the rpogram I was able to see how search_pa_list was used.
